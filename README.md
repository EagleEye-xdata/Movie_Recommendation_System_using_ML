üé¨ Movie Recommendation System ‚Äì Detailed Project Summary

üìå Project Objective:

The goal of this project was to create a content-based recommendation system that suggests similar movies to users based on the textual descriptions (movie overviews). Instead of relying on user ratings or watch history, this system finds recommendations by comparing the content of the movies themselves.

üßæ Dataset:

The project uses a dataset containing metadata of movies, including:

Title

Overview (plot description)

Genre, Tags, and more

This metadata allows us to analyze and compare movie plots using natural language processing (NLP).

üß† Approach & Methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handled null values: Overviews with missing data were filled with empty strings.

Lowercased the text: For consistency.

Removed stopwords & punctuation: Using NLTK to reduce noise.

Tokenization & Stemming: Reduced words to their root form using the Porter Stemmer (e.g., "running", "runs", "ran" ‚Üí "run") to normalize different word forms.

2. Feature Extraction:

Used CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert movie overviews into a bag-of-words (BoW) matrix.

This matrix represents each movie as a vector of word frequencies.

Only top words (by frequency) are considered to reduce dimensionality.

3. Similarity Calculation:

Calculated Cosine Similarity between all pairs of movie vectors.

This technique finds the angle between two vectors, indicating how close their content is.

Movies with higher cosine similarity values are more alike in terms of plot.

4. Recommendation Logic:

When a user inputs a movie title, the system:

Fetches the index of that movie.

Calculates similarity scores between that movie and every other movie in the dataset.

Sorts the scores in descending order.

Returns the top 5 most similar movies as recommendations.

üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used & Their Roles:

Library	                      Purpose


Pandas	                      Loading, cleaning, and manipulating the movie dataset.

NumPy	                        Numerical computations for similarity matrix and indexing.

NLTK	                        Natural Language Processing‚Äîtokenization, stemming, stopword removal.

scikit-learn	                CountVectorizer to vectorize text, cosine_similarity to measure similarity.

Matplotlib & Seaborn	        For data visualization (genre distribution, top movies, etc.).

üß™ Example Use Case:

If a user searches for "The Dark Knight", the system may recommend:

Batman Begins

The Prestige

Inception

Iron Man

Avengers: Infinity War

These are chosen not just because of genre, but due to the thematic and textual similarity in plot descriptions.

üìà What Makes It Cool:

It‚Äôs a pure content-based recommender, so it works even for new users (no cold start problem).

No need for user behavior or past history‚Äîjust the movie plot is enough.

Easy to scale and modify (e.g., you can combine genres, directors, or keywords in future versions)
